Welcome to Treasure of Conquest!

 Your mission is to travel the world while collecting as many treasures as possible.
 As you visit each country, you will be accompanied by a tour guide.
 This tour guide has been instructed to give you options to visit restaurants, attractions, go shopping, or return home!
 Your travels will be limited by the amount of money that you have.
 If you run out of money then you may visit an excursion in order to earn more.
 In order to travel to other countries, including back home, you must have enough to purchase tickets for the flight.
 You should also beware of evil-doers who are lurking within these countries!
 They will unexpectedly attack you in order to steal your health, money, and/or treasures!
 Defeat them to earn their goods. Lose, and they will take yours.
 If you run out of XP then you fail the mission and the game ends.
 If you return home, you have ended the game and your score will be based on the amount of treasure and money you have.

 Good luck!
